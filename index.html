I think it was really early on, probably like 10.<br>
I used to play with my parents' phones sometimes and try to see if I could go on the internet,<br>
but at the time you couldn't.<br>
My parents had a really, really old computer or laptop,<br>
and that's when I started finding YouTube and understanding what YouTube was and finding music in there<br>
and just engaging also with TV, with music.<br>
My mom used to have a music channel that she would play.<br>
Finding sources of music and what was new, what was English music.<br>
At the time I would mainly listen to Spanish,<br>
but then also starting to learn and see what English music was about.<br>
I would go to my cousin's house. I didn't have a gaming drive like other people.<br>
So I just paid attention to understand what Minecraft was, what was Roblox,<br>
and also playing dress-up games online.<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
Lady Gaga was big. The Black Eyed Peas were really big, Pitbull was really big.<br>
Having access to Qubo, stuff like that too, didn't have cable.<br>
I was probably late years of elementary, like fifth grade, fourth grade.<br>
It would mainly be Qubo and stuff that was free or channel 8 with PBS.<br>
That was my medium, like Elmo and stuff like that.<br>
I think we still watch it to this day.<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
...fondest memories of Minecraft?<br>
<br>
The aspect of building something. You can create your own world,<br>
but also get frustrated when something goes wrong.<br>
I would see my cousins crash out when something went wrong.<br>
It's kind of intense but also relaxing at the same time.<br>
You get to hear all the music in the background that Minecraft had,<br>
or the little sounds that the little person makes.<br>
It was just you and your world basically.<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
...games on Roblox?<br>
<br>
I used to play scary games sometimes.<br>
The natural disaster ones where you have to find shelter.<br>
We would all play as a trio and support each other as they played.<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
...any particular TV shows?<br>
<br>
I would watch WordGirl on PBS.<br>
I really liked her because she was brown and I'm brown.<br>
I could relate to her because she had a double life.<br>
She had to manage her family stuff but also manage the world.<br>
Save the world but also be home.<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
I thought the world was actually bigger, like it would be in El Salvador,<br>
but also being in the US.<br>
Wanting to be in both places expanded my view of the world.<br>
I wasn't just in Texas, which helped me not see my world as narrow.<br>
I think being downtown or getting in the plane, like of course getting in the plane when you're young,<br>
you're like, oh my God, you're so tiny compared to everything else.<br>
I think also getting lost in stores as a kid, that feels like endless.<br>
You can be in the store or the library for hours.<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
...main way of accessing the internet?<br>
<br>
I had a laptop too, but it started out with my cousins.<br>
Getting access to the internet was a little hard at the time.<br>
As I started getting older it was an investment.<br>
As you grow older, you start seeing less of your cousins.<br>
Getting your own computer and sometimes having sleepovers with them.<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
...any web series or music videos?<br>
<br>
I would watch lifestyle videos, like Seven Super Girls and<br>
they would talk about how their room was decorated and how they had access,<br>
lived in a big neighborhood and they were white, of course.<br>
My cousin was telling me how they decorated the room and how she wanted it like that.<br>
Also watching novelas at a really young age with my family<br>
even though I wasn't allowed to watch the kissing scenes.<br>
The YouTube videos of lifestyle, beauty, life hacks,<br>
or what high school is supposed to look like, that peaked back then.<br>
I remember before I went to high school I'd watch those "how to survive high school" videos.<br>
I literally bought a book like "how to survive college."<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
...any YouTubers you remember?<br>
<br>
David Dobrik. Wasabi Productions, they were so funny.<br>
And lifestyle and beauty channels basically.<br>
There were YouTubers who would do "what's in my emergency kit"<br>
or "get ready with me to school" morning routines.<br>
I feel like YouTube introduced me to beauty.<br>
I mainly got into it through YouTube, not really my mom.<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
...was it escapism or something to look forward to?<br>
<br>
Something to look forward to later on.<br>
But also a way to create art in different forms.<br>
I feel like I stopped doing art because it was never a priority I guess of mine.<br>
So then makeup was a different way of art to me. Or it still is.<br>
You got to perfect it and understand that one little thing can set it off.<br>
It was about forming your identity, finding out what fits you,<br>
finding your own groove. Making it work with what you have.<br>
I didn't have enough time to watercolor or didn't have the supplies.<br>
Makeup was different because makeup was more practical back then.<br>
I didn't live by an area where we had Michaels. We just had Walmart.<br>
I would save money and what I'd see in the grocery store is makeup,<br>
seeing all the lines of makeup and just trying to be like the YouTube video.<br>
A lifestyle basically. It was accessible in a way.<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
...first websites you ever interacted with?<br>
<br>
Poptropica, remember that stupid website. They shut it down.<br>
GirlsGoGames. Roblox.<br>
...<br>
It was a heavy laptop, like two times heavier.<br>
It was a VAIO or something like that. We still have it at my house.<br>
<br>
I love to play Cool Math Games.<br>
I still play that running game to this day. Run.<br>
There was also ABC Mouse.<br>
It started coming out as we were about to leave elementary.<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
...how did you learn to navigate a computer?<br>
<br>
My cousin was a geek with computers.<br>
He made my email account when I was really young.<br>
I didn't pay attention until I realized it's an actual email you can use.<br>
Learning what Netflix and Spotify and Pandora was.<br>
They were hella advanced with media. They knew about the gamer channels.<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
Movie Star Planet, you get to dress your Hollywood star and then you would chat.<br>
Just literally talking to randoms. I think I was trying to actually be friendly.<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
...any games you still go back to?<br>
<br>
Cool Math Games and Roblox to this day.<br>
I played the granny game on Roblox. Dress to Impress.<br>
I really liked the Roblox game where you got to build a whole life,<br>
you were able to build your own lifestyle and change cars and drive.<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
...did they feel like safe spaces?<br>
<br>
I think Roblox did. You could always do what you wanted. They were all chill.<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
...how did they shape your identity?<br>
<br>
They gave me some hope. I still think about that little Jeep I used to drive,<br>
those cars and what they looked like back then. The graphics of the game.<br>
My cousins would talk about GTA, FIFA, Call of Duty.<br>
They had an Xbox, a Wii, Nintendos.<br>
When they released those cute glittery DS collections,<br>
I was like I need to have one just for the aesthetic.<br>
I had the pink one and I still have it.<br>
I also had a PS Vita. I had a Shrek game on there.<br>
I had the Mario Kart game too.<br>
I also had movies on the PS. Karate Kid came with it. I love that movie.<br>
I remember when he kissed the girl. Me and my grandma were like... right.<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
...any TV shows?<br>
<br>
More like Barbie movies, that was my jam.<br>
The Shrek ones of course. Open Season was hilarious.<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
...Barbie movies that stuck with you?<br>
<br>
The Princess and the Pauper. Me and my cousin's favorite movie.<br>
You're just like me. Yes that one.<br>
Barbie and the Mermaid Tale, the Fashion Fairy Tale.<br>
All of them are my jam.<br>
In my apartments, the guy would come and sell the movies and my dad would get them.<br>
Or my cousin had them. Either one of us.<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
...favorite Shrek movie?<br>
<br>
The second one. I watched it like 300 times.<br>
Nobody can tell me nothing about Shrek.<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
Dora too. I was in love with Dora. And Diego.<br>
With Dora she just always had the freedom to go anywhere.<br>
She didn't care, just her with that little backpack and monkey.<br>
She was always asking me to translate stuff. I was like shut up.<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
...shows that really stuck with you or influenced you?<br>
<br>
Barbie in the Dream House. She just does her own thing.<br>
She doesn't really care. She's just chilling and making it.<br>
She's just that girl.<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
...shows you didn't like?<br>
<br>
Martha the dog would piss me off.<br>
Thomas the Train, get that boring stuff out of my face.<br>
I would love Mr. Bean cause my mom loved Mr. Bean. He was funny.<br>
I liked Pink Panther as a kid.<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
...did you watch Mickey Mouse Clubhouse?<br>
<br>
I didn't have access to it. I was only PBS.<br>
Barbie DVDs, as soon as the movies came out, I had them.<br>
Sometimes we would fight over a CD.<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
I wasn't really social. I was kind of scared of using social media.<br>
I only had Facebook. YouTube I wouldn't even comment, I would just like stuff.<br>
I was like it's gonna bite me in the ass one day. Your digital footprint.<br>
I was like I'm not gonna be a hater around here.<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
...did you collect any merchandise?<br>
<br>
The Shrek cups from McDonald's Happy Meals,<br>
they were like glass, actual good cups. Premium.<br>
I had a four-foot Dora coin collector statue. A Dora blanket.<br>
All One Direction stuff, backpacks, stickers, album books, posters.<br>
I still have one. Shirts from Justice.<br>
I couldn't afford Justice. I would just tell my dad let's go in. Try to convince him.<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
...what about novelas?<br>
<br>
El Chavo. Atrevete a Soñar. Vivan los Niños, them kids were badass.<br>
Familia Peluche of course.<br>
La Dueña. Lo Que la Vida Me Robó, that one was really popular.<br>
Maria del Barrio, me and my grandma used to watch together.<br>
Cuidado con el Ángel.<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
...was it more connection to your community or personal enjoyment?<br>
<br>
Personal enjoyment. I made my dad buy a One Direction backpack<br>
knowing everybody was into Justin Bieber.<br>
I liked stuff that people didn't like but they were still popular-ish.<br>
Like the second option.<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
...do you think your habits have changed over time?<br>
<br>
Now it's like finding a balance between what's real and what's not real.<br>
And also with AI, a lot of stuff tends to be fake nowadays.<br>
Continuously learning how to be grounded<br>
and what you believe in and not letting others shape your values.<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
...how kids use the internet now compared to back then?<br>
<br>
It's way too excessive now. They need to be stopped.<br>
There's no childhood like back then.<br>
Go color. Go mix. Like how they used to.<br>
You could literally be inside and do so much.<br>
My sister used to make slime. Now she doesn't make anything.<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
...any part of the early online world you miss?<br>
<br>
The safety of it. I feel like back then I was safer.<br>
Or maybe a delusion because we were young.<br>
But back then there was not so many things that could overwhelm somebody.<br>
Now with Instagram you have to get it at such a young age.<br>
The pressure of peers.<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
...what role do you think internet and media play in shaping who you are?<br>
<br>
Media influences culture and your values and what you perceive as your reality.<br>
What we consume shapes our way of thinking and socializing.<br>
Being more selective about what you're putting your mind and time to is very important.<br>
We shouldn't just be consuming garbage. We have to analyze what we consume.<br>
Algorithms have shaped us. We get a curated algorithm based on what you're looking for.<br>
It's not as diverse. Every app is trying to tailor to get you to buy something<br>
or make you align with what you think.<br>
